# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Purpose
Using Mapbox API and JavaScript to create earthquakes data overlaid with three different types of
maps. We would like to see how the data is related with the tectonic plate on the map.

### Result
##### <Fig.1 Three maps >

### Summary
We created earthquakes data with three different types of maps: street, satellite, and dark map.
In these maps, there are also three-layer of groups on the maps: major earthquake, M4.5+ Earthquakes
and tectonic plate data.Therefore, we can see the earthquake data on three different maps and also show how the data is
related to the tectonic plate.
